Axios: Axios is used to communicate with the backend and it also supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6.  
It is a library which is used to make requests to an API, return data from the API, and then do things with that data in our React application.

🌦️ Weather App

A simple and responsive Weather Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that allows users to check real-time weather data for any city using a public weather API.

🧭 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use web APIs in a front-end JavaScript app. It fetches live weather data from an API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.
It’s an ideal beginner project for learning how to integrate REST APIs, handle asynchronous operations, and update the DOM dynamically.

🚀 Features

🌍 Search weather by city name

🌡️ Display temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed

⚡ Instant data fetch using Fetch API

📱 Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

❌ Error handling for invalid or empty inputs

🧩 Easy to customize and extend

🧰 Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
HTML5	Structure and content of the app
CSS3	Styling, layout, and responsive design
JavaScript (ES6)	Core logic, event handling, and API calls
OpenWeatherMap API (or similar)	Source for live weather data
Fetch API / Async-Await	Handling asynchronous requests

🗝️ If you’re using OpenWeatherMap or another weather service, be sure to include your own API key inside script.js.
